I am currently collecting these emails to form a corpus of political emails for use in the Natural Language Processing community. I hope this dataset will help answer questions such as: “Do Democrats and Republicans speak differently?” “What issues do political candidates focus on in campaign correspondence?” “Does <code>&#x3C;email attribute></code> correlate with winning a political race?” and “Does one party speak more positively than another?” I anticipate that this dataset will contain close to 25,000 emails by November 2020, when I intend to end the collection phase of this research. <a href=\"https://github.com/schwartzadev/partisanship-db\">The code is available on GitHub</a>.
